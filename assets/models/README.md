# 3D Models

This directory should contain the `capybara.glb` file, which includes both the 3D model of a capybara and its idle animation.

## About the capybara.glb file
- The file should be a GLB format 3D model
- It should include at least one animation (idle)
- The model should be properly rigged for animation
- The model's forward direction should be along the positive Z-axis

You'll need to obtain or create this file separately and place it in this directory.
